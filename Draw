function [solution] = Square_Draw(image,centers,states)
%Draws a square of a given color to the matrix image centered at the 
%centroid given. imageSize must be a vector with the following values:
%[height,width,RGB] This is most easily accomplized by using the
%size(image)function as the value of imageSize.
%make a copy of the original image
solution = image;
for square = 1:9
for ii = centers(square,1)-96:centers(square,1)+96
    for jj = centers(square,2)-96:centers(square,2)+96
        switch states(square)
